#### Abstract
Environmental data are critical for advancing human health and conservation efforts, but these data are extremely hard to find and reuse. Even when publicly available, the data sets are usually siloed and not interoperable. Numerous challenges impede our progress in using environmental data collectively, including the lack of terminology standards and computable data models, the diversity of data types, and the size of the dataset (e.g., for satellite data layers).

This session will accept abstracts for 10-15 min presentations about environmental, public health, and geo-semantics, including but not limited to:
1. Methods for representing environments, habitats, exposures, and their associated data in a semantic model.
2. Demonstrations for linking data about environments to other data types
3. Use cases requiring linked environmental data
