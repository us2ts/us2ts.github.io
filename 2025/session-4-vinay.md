Details about Session 4, chaired by Vinay K. Chaudhri:

This tutorial introduces a multiagent copilot framework for Industrial AI, designed to enhance efficiency, adaptability, and explainability across real-world sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare. Grounded in neurosymbolic AI, which integrates machine learning, knowledge graphs, and rule-based reasoning, the session will demonstrate how human-in-the-loop and multiagent coordination can improve decision-making and collaboration in complex, resource-constrained environments. Participants will explore how these systems enable robust, customizable, and scalable AI solutions for industrial challenges. Through practical use cases, particularly in manufacturing, the session provides insights and tools that can be generalized to diverse domains seeking intelligent, trustworthy AI integration.
