# Call for Contributions (2022)

US2TS organizing committee is still accepting poster and lightning talk abstracts for the conference and we encourage session organizers to submit posters. To submit posters, please follow the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=us2ts0" target="_blank">EasyChair link</a>. We are also taking proposals for working sessions through EasyChair. Please include enough information in the proposal for participants to decide if they want to contribute. There is limited space/time so acceptance will be on a first-come-first-served basis.

- **Deadline for submissions: June 20th, 2022**
- **Notifications: July 1st, 2022**
- **Final program for the sessions: August 30th, 2022**
- **Symposium dates: Sept. 29 - Oct. 1, 2022**

The US2TS Symposium series is an emerging premier forum for fostering community between academic, industry and government researchers and practitioners in the US that develop or apply semantic technologies. The interest in semantics has been strengthened by the growing dependence on the Web and the continuously increasing importance of large-scale data sharing, integration, and reuse.

Semantics is an inherently multidisciplinary field that attracts engagement from a broad range of researchers and practitioners. Participants at the US2TS come from disciplines in computer science and engineering, natural sciences, geoscience, biology, library science, food science, biomedical and health care sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and many others. Discussions at the symposium cover core topics such as the Semantic Web, Ontologies, Knowledge Graph, Linked Data and AI on the Web, Privacy and Trust, etc., as well as the intersection of such topics with areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchains.

US2TS 2022 organizational committee invites your contributions and participation in the 2022 edition of US2TS to be held on Sept. 29 - Oct. 1, 2022 in East Lansing, Michigan State University, MI, USA.

This year we are welcoming a variety of session proposals, such as proposals for various types of working sessions, hackathons, tutorials, challenges (bring your own “sharks” for a panel!), education and technology tracks!

For early career scholars and graduate students, we do have NSF funding to support some travel. You can apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_1kP5TenhOKAmW1M1-ZQMtCjeeSvToGi8L9l-NcSJW_bumg/viewform?usp=pp_url).

# Call for Session Proposals

We solicit anyone with an interest in the Semantic Web to propose a session for US2TS 2022. A session is any relevant activity that can fit into a 90 minutes slot (you can also propose a session that takes more than one slot).

Examples of sessions include:
- a panel discussion
- a series of presentations on a topic
- breakout-style discussions on a proposed topic
- a tutorial
- hackathon
- challenges (bring your own “sharks”)
- education track
- technology track

As the main goal of the Symposium is to foster synergies and collaborations from different fields, we recommend that:
1. At least 2-3 people, preferably from different institutions, propose the session. This is not a strict requirement, mostly a recommendation (if you have a good case for a different setting we will definitely take your proposal into account).
2. All the session leaders are asked to confirm and commit to participate at the time of submission.
3. If your proposal already names speakers or panelists, you must state whether their participation is already confirmed. We encourage session proposals about cross-discipline topics which are of concern for participants from existing sub-communities.

### **Submission Goals**

Please prepare a (max) 2 page submission indicating:

- Name of the session
- Topic: please indicate which cross-discipline topics the session will tackle. Here you can also specify if there is any particular vertical of interest (e.g. legal, life science, medical, publisher/scholarly data, cultural heritage, library, museum, oil/gas, engineering, airplane, e-commerce, etc)
- Type of session: Panel / Presentations / Break-out discussion / Tutorial / BOF / Other (please specify)
- Short description of the session
- The 2/3 person team (names & affiliations) that will lead the session
- Speakers (when applicable). It is strictly required to specify the speakers if you are proposing a panel, in which case they must be already confirmed.
- Expected participation (give a prediction of who would be interested in attending your session)
- Submit your proposal on <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=us2ts0" target="_blank">Easychair</a>.

### **Symposium Outcome**

After the Symposium we will invite all session chairs to co-edit a summary of the event or a position paper, if possible, which will be formally published.
