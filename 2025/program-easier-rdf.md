#### Abstract

This will be an interactive session to discuss possible steps toward lowering the adoption barrier for RDF. The goal is to enable average developers (middle 33% of ability) to develop successful RDF applications. Several practical steps will be proposed and discussed, including:
- creating a central RDF website;
- standardizing knowledge graphs and n-ary relations;
- standardizing canonical RDF;
- standardizing query-friendly arrays; and
- deprecating RDF/XML

Several areas of research will also be proposed, including:
- support for RDF molecules;
- stable scoped identifiers;
- integrating RDF inference rules into programming languages;
- node renaming; and
- simplifying the RDF model to one identifier space based on URIs/IRIs.
