## **Open Knowledge Network: An NSF Convergence Accelerator Pilot**

#### **Abstract**

To help advance the progression from data to information to knowledge, and to fully harness the data revolution, the National Science Foundation seeks to enable the creation
of a nonproprietary shared knowledge infrastructure—an [Open Knowledge Network (OKN)](https://www.nitrd.gov/pubs/open-knowledge-network-workshop-report-2018.pdf). This effort is being supported as a “track,” or theme, under NSF’s new Convergence Accelerator program, whose vision is to identify areas of use-inspired research where investment in convergent approaches – those bringing together people from across disciplines, united to solve problems – have the potential to translate to high-benefit results and advance ideas from concept to [directed deliverables](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/). The Convergence Accelerator expands and refines NSF’s efforts to support fundamental scientific exploration by creating partnerships in use-inspired, translational research.

The Open Knowledge Network idea was presented at the inaugural US2TS Symposium held in March 2018. In this talk, we will present the current status of this NSF-supported activity. From the first set of 43 Convergence Accelerator planning awards made in August 2019, 21 are in the Open Knowledge Network track. In May 2020, a subset of these projects (~5) will enter the implementation phase. The current set of projects cover a wide range of domains and address a range of technical issues related to the creation and use of knowledge networks/graphs. The projects are expected to leverage the significant extant work in this area in academia as well as industry.

The Convergence Accelerator program is in pilot mode in 2019. New tracks/themes are expected to be announced each year. Specific funding opportunities will be announced through
Dear Colleague Letters, program announcements, and/or solicitations. Information about the program is available at the [website](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/).
