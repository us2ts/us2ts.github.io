We are seeking to understand the interests and motivations of prospective participants, who are already planning or are considering to attend the 3rd US2TS.

**Form for Intended Participation:** [https://forms.gle/7VdmyBH6XWFrffQM6]

We would appreciate if you could fill out the above form to help us gather additional information to structure a productive yet distinct program for this symposium.

There is no commitment for you to fill this form out. Even if there is only a small chance that you would be attending this year, we would request you to fill out the form. The data that is collected is going to be used only to inform how the program should be organized. We will maintain the results private. Name, organization and email is optional. If you do fill it out, we may contact you to follow up on any questions we may have.

We look forward to your great contributions and participation. See you all on March 9 - 11, 2020, Raleigh, USA.
