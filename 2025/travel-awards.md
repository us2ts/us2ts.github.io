To help reduce travel costs that would otherwise be a barrier to attending US2TS 2020, students and early-career professionals can apply for travel support awards.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Who is Eligible?
Travel support applications are open to students (graduate and undergraduate), postdocs, and early-career professionals (within 1 year of receiving highest degree).

----------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Apply?
Fill out the online US2TS 2020 Travel Support Application Form here: [https://forms.gle/tHjJFHHbFJYCoQEo7](https://forms.gle/tHjJFHHbFJYCoQEo7)

The firm application deadline is February 4, 2020. No extensions.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Selection Criteria
Selection is based on the following criteria. Make sure that you include sufficient information on the application form for us to judge each criterion.

What is your participation in the US2TS 2020 event and in the semantic technologies community? We look for both your plans at the event, and your past participation in projects in the semantic technologies space and community.

Increasing diversity: Does your attendance increase diversity at US2TS and in the community? We understand increasing diversity as increasing participation from groups otherwise underrepresented in the community and US2TS, including but not limited to underrepresented demographic groups, ethnic origins, career stages, and people with disabilities.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Review and Notification
Applications will be reviewed by the US2TS Organizing Committee. We intend to notify applicants by February 7, 2020. Awardees who have not yet registered will be able to do so at the Early Registration rate even if the early registration deadline has passed. Awardees will be required to confirm acceptance and to register at the latest by February 11, 2020 to avoid forfeiting their award to waitlisted applicants.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## What Does a Travel Support Award Cover?
The Travel Support Award can be used to cover direct travel costs (such as airfare, train, metro, bus and taxi), hotel, child-care and / or conference registration fees up to a value of USD 500. Rental car expenses and personal car mileage are not eligible for reimbursement.

We anticipate that these awards will supplement travel costs, not cover all expenses. If you are a student and you require more than USD 500 to be able to attend the event, please include a justification on the application form, including name and contact email for your supervisor who can provide a letter of support confirming that additional funds to cover excess costs are unavailable.

Awardees will be reimbursed after US2TS 2020 by NC State University based on receipts provided and proof of attendance. There is no cash value beyond eligible and documented expenses. All reimbursement claims must be filed within 30 days after conclusion of the event, after which the award expires. We will also ask you to state for our records that none of your claimed expenses have been or will be reimbursed from another source (e.g. your employer, or a grant).
