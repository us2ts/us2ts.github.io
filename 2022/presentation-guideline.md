We hope you are as excited as we are about your work and its upcoming presentation at the US2TS Symposium! The following information is intended to help you prepare your work for presentation, whether in paper or lightning round format.

**Paper Presentation Expectations:** As you prepare your individual presentations, we ask you to be mindful of time and moderators. Our moderators will remind you when you have 5, 2 and 1 minute(s) remaining.  Please be respectful of their remaining time indicators so that we will have plenty of time for Q&A and further discussion.

**Audio/Visual Equipment:** Your presentation room will be equipped with: an Internet-connected PC, a projector screen, and an HDMI hookup. You are strongly encouraged to save and store your presentation in a way that enables you to access it easily, e.g. via USB drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud-based platform. If you choose to bring your own personal computer for presentation purposes, please bring any additional adapters or equipment necessary to ensure the success of your presentation.

**Online Engagement:** Please be mindful of presenters’ privacy when it comes to sharing photos, video, and other presentation content from conference sessions, and abide by any expressed wishes to keep certain content offline. When you do post about the conference on social media, please include #us2ts2022 in your posts and tweets.

If you have any additional questions or require special accommodations, please contact us at [US2TS2022@gmail.com](mailto:US2TS2022@gmail.com)

We wish you safe travels, and we look forward to welcoming you to Michigan State University!
