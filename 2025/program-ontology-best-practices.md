#### Abstract
Knowledge graphs are poised to become increasingly significant disruptors in both the private and public sectors. For example, the ongoing convergence accelerator through the NSF, called the Open Knowledge Network, emphasizes connecting knowledge graphs across myriad institutions and the methods and tools to do so, as well as developing reusable domain ontologies. Of particular interest for this break-out session are the use development and maintenance of so-called ontology families, such as OBO, in addition to more recent and ongoing efforts such as the Industrial Ontology Foundry and Common Core Ontologies.

While, for any particular knowledge graph, there are currently a number of methodologies and techniques to construct them, such as using upper ontologies, modular ontology design, ontology design patterns, dead simple owl design patterns, OTTR, and data shapes and constraints, it is perhaps not clear exactly how they fit together, nor how they may support the development of ontology families. It is our belief that these methodologies are not mutually exclusive.

As such, we propose a break-out style session, whose purpose is to explore the interplay between these different paradigms. In some cases, the pairwise interplay are already being explored. We wish to use this session as a mechanism to solicit community direction, identify methodological and tooling infrastructure gaps, and provide a cross-domain, multi-paradigm support network.
