#### Abstract

This session will provide an exposition of semantic techniques for data integration and harmonization that have been employed in the earth and environmental sciences, but are general in nature and may be employed across a range of domains. Panel members (prominent contributors and members of ESIP, the OBO Foundry, Ontolog Forum, OGC, W3C, etc.) have expertise ranging from earth and environmental science, to molecular ecosystems biology, ecology and evolution, to architecture, engineering and construction as well as semantic and ontological modelling and methods. Session presentations will stress production-grade technologies, data semantics and their applications which lay strong emphasis on interoperability. Finally, the session will close by notionalizing the concept of a Earth and space systems ontology foundry and crowdsourcing the architecture and purpose of such an effort.

#### Session structure

* Data semantics within Earth and environmental science (Anne Thessen and Ramona Walls)
* Semantic harmonization efforts at the ESIP Federation (Ruth Duerr, Gary-Berg Cross, Pier Luigi)
* Ontology alignment tasks for Earth and space systems applications (Lu Zhou, Lewis McGibbney, Chris Mungall)
* Forming an Earth and space systems ontology foundry (All)
